# Data_Preprocessing_Pipeline
Data preprocessing is a critical step in data science tasks, ensuring that raw data is transformed into a clean, organized, and structured format suitable for analysis.

A data preprocessing pipeline streamlines this complex process by automating a series of steps, enabling data professionals to efficiently and consistently preprocess diverse datasets. 

The pipeline consists of interconnected steps, each of which is responsible for a specific preprocessing task, such as:

imputing missing values
scaling numeric features
finding and removing outliers
or encoding categorical variables
